# OSM to PMTiles Conversion Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an efficient system for converting OpenStreetMap (OSM) .pbf files to PMTiles format for smooth loading and performance on web applications. The system will be deployed on a VPS and provide interactive mapping capabilities with layer filtering and toggling functionality.

## Key Objectives
- Convert OSM .pbf files to PMTiles format efficiently
- Ensure optimal loading performance for web applications
- Implement layer filtering and toggling capabilities
- Deploy on VPS with proper configuration
- Provide a user-friendly web interface for map interaction

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js/Python for processing
- **Map Processing**: Tippecanoe for vector tile generation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- **Frontend**: Modern JavaScript framework (React/Vue.js) with Mapbox GL JS
- **File Format**: PMTiles for efficient serving
- **Server**: VPS with Docker containerization
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

## Technical Requirements

### Server Requirements
- **CPU**: 4+ cores for processing
- **RAM**: 16GB+ for large OSM files
- **Storage**: SSD with 100GB+ available space
- **Network**: High bandwidth for file uploads/downloads

### Software Dependencies
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ or Python 3.9+
